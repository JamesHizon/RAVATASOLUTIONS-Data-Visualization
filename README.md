# RAVATA SOLUTIONS: Data Visualization

The following includes information to help guide me in preparing to preprocess data using Pandas for data visualization for Ravata Solutions.

In this project, I am currently an intern working with raw data of a device used for IVF. RAVATA SOLUTIONS seeks to speed the process of embryo reproduction for lab mice experimentation. The data I am currently working with has to deal with factors such as voltage, frequency, impedance, phase, conductance, susceptance, resistance, and reactance. Additionally, I worked heavily on preprocessing data and data cleansing, in order to visualize data using pandas. I am in the process of further visualization through the "plotly" package, after working side-by-side with the "pandas" and "matplotlib" packages. Furthermore, I will be able to incorporate machine learning in the future of the internship, as I reconstruct the work done by professional data scientists.
